<h2>Problem Statement: </h2>
The prime purpose of this project is to demonstrate the functionality of Secure RSA using MT19937 and Miller-Rabin primality testing. MT19937 is the most popular pseudorandom number generator and is even used in pythonâ€™s inbuilt rand method. The performance is shown by graphs generated using MatplotLib

<h2>Highlights:</h2>
1. Upto 2048 bit long private key was generated
2. Computational time for key generation showed significant performance

<h2>Algorithms Implemented:</h2>
1. Secure RSA
2. MersenneTwister (MT19937) 
3. Karatsuba Multiplication
4. Miller-Rabin primality test
